Zero2D is a conglomeration of ideas expressed in several past fighting games.

"Zero2D" is multifaceted term. It originates from "zero-to-death", a saying used in the Super Smash Bros. community where a player executes a perfect combo that takes the opponent from "zero" (zero damage or full health) to "death" (KO off one of the sides) without taking any damage himself. The title Zero2D also makes reference to the 2D sprite-nature of the engine. :)
