/**
 *  ABSTRACT -- NetworkStream has a very simple focus: move blocks of memory
 *              between the client and server. In other words, regardless of how
 *              big the message is, it needs to be properly divided, labeled,
 *              and transmitted with respect to the allotted packet size. In
 *              many respects, it will mimic TCP's reliability but have the
 *              benefit of speedy UDP through reduced overhead and added
 *              tolerance for lost packets.
 *
 *  (1) break messages across packets -- Every packet needs a small header
 *      indicating what message it is a part of (message ID), how many packets
 *      constitute the message, and what packet this is in the series.
 *
 *  (2) manage message pieces -- Every packet needs to be tracked carefully. If
 *      pieces of unrelated messages show up, they need to be stored properly
 *      for when the rest of the message arrives.
