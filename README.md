# zero2d
::: Z E R O 2 D ::: open source fighter engine -- seeking contributors!

This has been a long time coming. I have always wanted to make my own PC game fighter inspired by Super Smash Bros. 
king-of-the-hill platformer style combat. Here are the important facts surrounding this project:

* Zero2D will be built in the spirit of MUGEN. 
It will operate as a generic engine and allow the community to add characters and stages freely.
* Zero2D will be written in C++ for optimal performance and guaranteed support for the big three (Windows, Macintosh, and GNU/Linux).
* Zero2D will be a 2D fighter using sprites. 
This is to ensure that anyone can contribute to the fighter/stage rosters.
* Zero2D will be open source. Programmers can contribute to the engine, while the rest of the community will help form characters and stages (no programming knowledge will be necessary).
* Zero2D will pave the way for a truly competitive smash fighter. 
By having absolute control over all aspects of the game, true balance can be attained! (Of course, people can also make insanely broken characters for their own leisure.)
* Zero2D will offer superior online play. LAN play will also be an option.
